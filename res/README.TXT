If you're in DOS then congratulations, just run GAME.EXE and you're on your way! 
 
If you are on an Operation System from this century... running this game will be a bit more involved. 
 
If you're a DOSBox aficionado, or prefer to use a different DOS emulator, feel free to stop reading now ^_^ 
 
 
~Running "Virtual Escape" in "DOSBox"~ 
 
 
-First download DOSBox, make sure to pick the correct one for you're operating system: 
 http://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1 
 
-It's advisable that you then create a short easy to remember/type folder that has no spaces. 
 We'll assume you pick "C:\DOSBOX\" for this readme. 
 
-Next move this entire games folder into the "C:\DOSBOX\" folder you just created. 
 
-Now launch DOSBox, it will open a DOS window running at ~3MHz... 
 We'll need that to be closer to the 45MHz of early 90's hardware. 
 You can increase the emulation speed by pressing CONTROL and F12 at the same time 
 (there is a number in the title bar that starts at 3000,  press CNTL+F12 until that is around 45000, 
  if you go over CNTL+F11 will decrease the speed). 
 In the last step we will go over how to make sure the speed is ideal for you computer. 
 You could wait until then to change DOSBox's CPU speed. 
 
-Now we can launch the game, in DOSBox type: 
 mount c c:\DOSBOX\ 
 c: 
 cd VIRT_ESC 
 GAME.EXE 
 
-If all goes according to plan the game should now be running. You can use CNTL+F11 and CNTL+F12 to tune the 
 games speed to your computer. (The speed doesn't matter too much, but input can be dropped if it is too low) 
 I might just turn the speed up to the lowest number that will run the game smoothly (move the mouse to see 
 how much input lag there is).

-You can make the game full screen by pressing ALT+Enter, or editing DOSBox's config file for more control over
 how the game is displayed.
